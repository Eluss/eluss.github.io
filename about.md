Hi, I'm Eliasz Sawicki - iOS developer from Gdansk.

I love creating things which make people's lives easier and writing best quality iOS apps is one of those things.

I am passionate about personal development and I'm constantly looking for methods to improve my productivity.

I believe that we can achieve more than we can think of.

Currently I work at Bright Inventions, check out our [blog](http://blog.brightinventions.pl/)!
