Recently I've started playing with "git log" command in order to simplify my daily update routine. After some time I found a command that fills my needs.

The command basicly prints commits that user "Eliasz Sawicki" has done within last day.

Moreover you can simply send updates with mail changing this command to:

If you find your mails in spam, try configuring your postfix.
